- Recent decisions and rationale
- Immediate next steps

### Daily Memory (24-48 hours)
- Daily goals and progress
- Key learnings and insights
- Pattern observations
- Context for next session

### Project Memory (Weeks-Months)
- Long-term objectives
- Project evolution
- Decision history
- Strategic context

### Domain Memory (Persistent)
- Core competencies
- Established patterns
- Fundamental preferences
- Knowledge graphs

## Pattern Library
### Problem-Solving Approaches
1. **Systematic Breakdown**
   - Decompose complex tasks into manageable components
   - Use TodoWrite for tracking and visibility
   - Apply structured templates and frameworks

2. **Integration-First Thinking**
   - Consider how new elements fit existing ecosystem
   - Prioritize interoperability and connection
   - Build bridges between systems

3. **Automation-Oriented**
   - Identify repetitive patterns for automation
   - Create scripts and workflows for efficiency
   - Document and systematize processes

### Communication Patterns
- **Planning Phase:** Use TodoWrite, present comprehensive overview
- **Execution Phase:** Focus on specific tasks, minimal commentary
- **Completion Phase:** Summarize outcomes, identify next steps
- **Learning Phase:** Extract patterns, update memory systems

## Optimization Protocols
### Context Switching
When switching between projects or domains:
1. Save current context to appropriate memory file
2. Load relevant project/domain context
3. Update session memory with transition
4. Align on objectives and constraints

### Memory Consolidation
End of session protocol:
1. Update daily memory with key insights
2. Identify patterns for pattern library
3. Archive completed contexts
4. Prepare context for next session

### Knowledge Integration
New learning integration:
1. Connect to existing knowledge graphs
2. Update domain memory
3. Identify cross-domain applications
4. Document for future reference

## Decision Framework
### Evaluation Criteria
- **Alignment:** Does this support long-term objectives?
- **Integration:** How does this connect with existing systems?
- **Scalability:** Can this approach grow and evolve?
- **Efficiency:** What's the effort-to-value ratio?
- **Learning:** What insights and patterns emerge?

### Trade-off Management
- **Completeness vs Speed:** When to optimize for thoroughness vs rapid iteration
- **Automation vs Control:** Balance between automated systems and manual oversight
- **Complexity vs Simplicity:** Sophisticated solutions vs straightforward approaches

## Adaptive Learning
### Success Patterns
- Structured templates accelerate productivity
- Integration between systems creates compound value
- Automation of routine tasks enables focus on high-value activities
- Regular reflection and analysis improves decision-making

### Challenge Patterns
- Over-engineering solutions before validating core needs
- Complexity creep in systems design
- Context switching without proper memory management

### Evolution Triggers
- New tools or capabilities that change possibility space
- Shifts in priorities or objectives
- Discovery of more efficient patterns
- Integration opportunities between previously separate domains

## Integration Points
